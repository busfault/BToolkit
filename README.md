The BToolkit, a toolkit supporting software development with the B-method.

About B
=======

B is a generic term given to a method of software development, the B-Method,
its process and notation and and its supporting toolset, the B-Toolkit.

B is a sound mathematically-based technology for application within a practical Software Process.

The B-Method is designed to provide a notation and a method for
requirements modeling, software interface specification, software
design, implementation and maintenance, thus supporting the major
phases of a software process. Incremental construction of layered
software as well as its incremental verification and validation are
the guiding principles of the B-Method.

The B-Toolkit supports the B-method over the entire software process
and comprises a large suite of tools which can run automatically or
interactively. All tools are integrated into a window-based
development environment. The tool supports the incremental
construction of the software. The validation processes are supported
by static analysis which employ and checking, by dynamic analysis
using simulation, as well as proof of correctness using an integrated
theorem prover (the B-ToolProvers).
