#This script typically completes any required configuration of the package foo
#once foo has been unpacked from its Debian archive (".deb") file.
#Often, 'postinst' scripts ask the user for input, and/or warn the user that if he
#accepts default values, he should remember to go back and re-configure that package
#as the situation warrants. Many 'postinst' scripts then execute any commands necessary
#to start or restart a service once a new package has been installed or upgraded.
