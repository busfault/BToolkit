Ubuntu
======

B-Toolkit has been tried on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. Both x86 and
x86_64 should work.

Note: There are no lesstif packages for Ubuntu 14.04; use openmotif
instead.

Build requirements (to be installed with apt-get):
- flex
- motif (e.g. lesstif2-dev or libmotif-dev)
- tcsh

Build procedure:
$ cd BToolkit/UTIL/
$ export PATH=`pwd`:${PATH}
$ ./BUILD
(answer 'N' and then 'A')

Note: recent versions of openmotif support font anti-aliasing,
which can be enabled by:
$ cp MOTIF/BMotif.resources.xft ~/XBMotif

Run:
$ cd BKIT
$ export BKIT=`pwd`
$ cd BDEMO
$ ../BToolkit

Mac OS X Yosemite
=================

For this to run on a Mac, you'll need:

 * the X11 app installed (download from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)
 * X-Motif
 
 To install X-Motif first install xcode and then install macports:
 
 Download xcode from http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835
 
 Open a terminal and type in:
 
 sudo xcodebuild -license
 xcode-select --install
 
 Install macports from http://www.macports.org/install.php
 
 Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf
 
 e.g.
 
nano /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf
 
Ensure that the following line reads:
 
universal_archs x86_64 i386
 
Become root:
 
sudo -s

Use macports to install openmotif:

/opt/local/bin/port
port self update
port upgrade outdated
port install openmotif +universal

You should now be able to run the BToolkit by opening the disk image (see releases), copying the application to your applications folder and then clicking on application icon.
