BToolkit
========

The BToolkit is a toolkit supporting software development with the B-method.

The B-Method was initially devised by Jean-Raymond Abrial during his time at the Programming Research Group
at the [University of Oxford](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk). Then the B tools were developed at BP Research. BP assigned the rights
for these tools to B-Core (UK) Ltd. The B-Toolkit was developed at B-Core by Ib Sorensen and David Neilson from 1992.

The source code to the B-Toolkit has been posted in memory of Ib Sorensen. [Ib Sorensen - In memoriam](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/448-full.html)

B-Core no longer supports or maintains the B-Toolkit.

About B
=======

B is a generic term given to a method of software development, the B-Method,
its process and notation and to its supporting toolset, the B-Toolkit.

B is a sound, mathematically-based technology for application within a practical Software Process.

The B-Method is designed to provide a notation and a method for
requirements modeling, software interface specification, software
design, implementation and maintenance, thus supporting the major
phases of a software process. Incremental construction of layered
software as well as its incremental verification and validation are
the guiding principles of the B-Method.

The B-Toolkit supports the B-method over the entire software process
and comprises a large suite of tools which can run automatically or
interactively. The tool supports the incremental
construction of the software. The validation processes are supported
by static analysis, by dynamic analysis using simulation, as well as proof
of correctness using an integrated theorem prover (the B-ToolProvers).
