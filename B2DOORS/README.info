               B to DOORS   Bridge
               ===================


Using the B to Doors Bridge
===========================

Typical Scenario :

1) Start a new B-Development and set the Optional Utility as
   described above.

2) Use the Optional Utility 'Bdoors' to start Doors.

step 3,4 below can happen in any order

3) In the started Doors:
   a) In Doors create a new Project for holding the Modules
      ( requirement documents, design documents,  AMN document ).
   b) In Doors create  requirement documents Modules  by using
      general Doors facilities ( e.g. templates, general imports )

4) In the related B development:
   Use the B-Toolkit facilities to create AMN specification and
   AMN designs and Analyse these formal descriptions.

  
step 5,6 below can now be repeated several times as the development
and its description progresses over time.

5) In Doors
  a) 'Import AMN' 
      This will automatically create a Doors AMN Module giving a
      Doors view of all configured specification (.mch), designs (.ref)
      and implementations ( .imp ) from the B development.
      ( Several Link Modules for internal administration will also
      be created, and the Module of interest is the Formal Module
      within the Project)
      The Doors view consists of a collection of identifiable Objects. 
      Specification , Designs or Implementations are made up of
      several Objects, e.g. and AMN  Operation is an Object, the
      specified Invariant is an Object.
  b) Inspect the AMN and create links from the AMN Objects to
      existing Objects in the requirement documents or design
      document created in step 3. ( or create these documents now
      as Doors Modules). At this time you may also make changes
      to the imported documents themselves using the Doors editing
      facilities; you might also add new Objects e.g. Operations.

  c) 'Export AMN' from the Doors AMN Module.
       This will make the 'links', and other changes made during 
       session b) above available within the related B-Toolkit
       development environment ( see below) 
   
  d) 'HTML export requirements' from the NON AMN Modules.
       This will make the 'NON AMN Module', i.e the informal
       requirements and the informal design documentation created
       in step 3) above, accessible when using the  B-Toolkit Browser 
       in the related B-Development.

6)  In The B-Toolkit  
    Returning to the B-Toolkit after session 5 above, the user is
    visually notified of the changed made to the development.
    Within the Main development control panel all constructs
    which have been affected by the Doors session will be marked
    ( with a ! ).
 
    a)
    The changes made to the individual construct can be immediately
    committed into the B-Development by using the 'cmt' tool-bar
    facility. 
    The B-Toolkit will manage the consequences of committing any
    changes. 
    If only link information which relate the AMN construct to the
    informal documentation have been inserted then the B-Toolkit's
    then the related 'browsable' documents will be changed. 
    If the mathematical text of the construct have been changed then
    all dependent work ( e.g. proofs ) will be removed, ready for
    the general B-Toolkit 're-make' facility to recover the removed
    work wherever possible.

    b)
    All changes made during the Doors session can be inspected using
    the 'top bar' 'Commit All Updated Constructs' facility. A list
    of all modified constructs is displayed and selected constructs
    can be inspected for changes and individually committed.

    c) 
    Using the 'top bar' Browse Hypertext facility the AMN and the
    produced C-code (if any) can be inspected in the context of the 
    informal requirement documentation exported from Doors to the B-Toolkit 
    as described in 5 d) above.
    The Browsing facilities in the combined Doors and B-Toolkit environment
    allow for code fragment to be related - through the automatically 
    inserted links within the B formal development - to statements
    in the informal document managed by doors.



Summary of facilities Provided by the 'B to Doors Bridge'
=======================================================


 In Doors :

   1) Import AMN
      A collection of scripts ( DXL ) which allow the Doors user to
      extract a selection of AMN constructs from a B development.
      The constructs are copied from the B-Toolkit CFG directory
      and a simple parser creates Doors Modules to hold the
      Doors view of the selected AMN construct. 

   2) Export AMN
      A collection of scripts ( DXL ) which allow the Doors user to
      extract a collection of AMN constructs from the Door database.
      The constructs are parsed to create B Toolkit formatted
      constructs and copied into the SRC directory of the related
      B development.

   3) HTML Export Requirements
      A script which allow the user to convert a doors Module
      into HTML format and to copy it into the HTML directory of the 
      related B development.


   In the B-Toolkit :

   1) The 'Change Notification Facility'.
      An extension to the B-Toolkit which check for 
      modified constructs to arrive from a
      Doors session. Notifications are given on the Main
      Panel and changes can be commited into the B development
      under the user control.

   2) The 'Update All Updated Constructs' Facility.
      An extension to the B-Toolkit Construct Utility which
      allow the user to inspect and selectively commit changes
      into the B development.     

   3) Traceability Enhancements
      The Browse Hypertext facility of the B-Toolkit has been
      extended to allow a simple tracing from C code fragments
      to informal requirement document. This facility utilises
      links automatically inserted into the hierarchy of the
      formal software design
. 
   

   Industrial Interest :

   The 'B to Doors Bridge' was exhibited and demonstated at  
   FM'99 ( 20-24 September ) conference in Toulouse, France.
   The new technology attracted interest from both Industry
   and educational institutions.
