/*" This specification models the built-in PASP {\em SIGNED\/} ({\em
INTEGER\/}) type using the four conversion {\em SIGNED-NAT\/}
functions {\em n2ps\/}, {\em n2ns\/}, {\em ns2n\/}, and {\em ps2n\/}.
{\em MinSgn\/} and {\em MaxSgn\/} are also defined.

The operations comprise the six comparison functions {\em SLE, SGE,
SLT, SGT, SEQ, SNE\/}, the seven arithmetic functions {\em SADD,
SSUB, SMUL, SDIV, SMOD, SINC\/} and {\em SDEC\/}.

Each of the operations is translated directly in terms of the binary
operators $&lt;=$, $&gt;=$, $&lt;$, $&gt;$, $=$, $<>$, $+$, $-$, $\times$,
{\tt DIV} and {\tt MOD}, as appropriate by the B-PASP Translator.  "*/

PROPERTIES

/*"
We ensure that the the five basic arithmetic operations
are defined for {\em SIGNED\/}; we model each as a {\em partial\/}
function (for example, not all pairs of {\em SIGNED\/}
when added together will produce an {\em SIGNED\/}):

   ? - ?   : SIGNED * SIGNED +-&gt; SIGNED &
   ? * ?   : SIGNED * SIGNED +-&gt; SIGNED &
   ? / ?   : SIGNED * SIGNED +-&gt; SIGNED &
   ? mod ? : SIGNED * SIGNED +-&gt; SIGNED &

/*" We define the {\em NAT\/} to positive {\em SIGNED\/} conversion
function ({\em n2ps\/}) as a total injections between natural numbers
in the range {\em 0\/} to {\em 32767\/} and {\em SIGNED\/} (i.e.\
there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the two); we define the {\em
NAT\/} to negative {\em SIGNED\/} conversion function ({\em n2ns\/})
as a total injections between natural numbers in the range {\em 1\/}
to {\em 32768\/} and {\em SIGNED\/}; the {\em SIGNED\/} to {\em
NAT\/} functions may then be defined as their inverses:"*/

the boolean value of its~argument.\\[1ex]

that both input and output parameters are of type {\em SIGNED\/};
the former ensures that the operation is invoked safely, and
the latter that we do not have to deal with undefinedness.
