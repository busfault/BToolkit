Ubuntu
======

B-Toolkit has been tried on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. Both x86 and x86_64 work.

To install this on a debian based system, download the source code and compile it.

Download the latest release of the BToolkit (the source code zip file or the tar.gz) from
https://github.com/edwardcrichton/BToolkit/releases

Unpack it:

$ unzip V6.0.4.zip
or
$ gunzip V6.0.4.tar.gz
$ tar xvf V6.0.4.tar

Note: There is a choice of using the lesstif or openmotif libraries.
However, there are no lesstif packages for Ubuntu 14.04 onwards, so it's best to choose openmotif instead.

Build requirements (to be installed with apt-get):
- flex
- motif (e.g. lesstif2-dev or libmotif-dev)
- tcsh
e.g.
$ sudo apt-get install flex libmotif-dev csh build-essential

Build procedure:
$ cd BToolkit/UTIL/
$ export PATH=`pwd`:${PATH}
$ ./BUILD
(answer 'N' and then 'A')

Note: recent versions of openmotif support font anti-aliasing,
which can be enabled by putting a configuation file in your home directory:
$ cp MOTIF/BMotif.resources.xft ~/XBMotif

To run:
$ cd BKIT
$ export BKIT=`pwd`
$ cd BDEMO
$ ../BToolkit


Mac OS X Yosemite
=================

Download the latest release of the BToolkit for Mac OS (the .dmg file) from
https://github.com/edwardcrichton/BToolkit/releases

For this to run on a Mac, you'll also need:

 * the X11 app installed found in the App Store (or for older versions download from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)
 * X-Motif
 
 To install X-Motif, first install xcode and then install macports:
 
 xcode:
 
 Download xcode from the App Store (or for older versions http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
 
 Then open a terminal and type in:
 
 sudo xcodebuild -license
 xcode-select --install
 
 macports:
 
 Install macports from http://www.macports.org/install.php
 
 Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf
 
 e.g.
 
nano /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf
 
Ensure that the following line reads:
 
universal_archs x86_64 i386
 
Become root:
 
sudo -s

Use macports to install openmotif:

/opt/local/bin/port
port self update
port upgrade outdated
port install openmotif +universal

You should now be able to run the BToolkit by opening the disk image (.dmg)
(see releases https://github.com/edwardcrichton/BToolkit/releases),
copying the application to your applications folder and then clicking on application icon.
